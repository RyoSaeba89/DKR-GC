/*
 * obj_animate, translated from src/hasm/obj_animate.s.
 *
 * Hand-written MIPS with no C counterpart in the repository, so this is a
 * reading of the assembly rather than a recovered original. It is not written
 * to match: the GameCube port never assembles the .s, and the only thing that
 * has to hold is behaviour.
 *
 * WHAT THE ANIMATION FORMAT IS, as the assembly describes it.
 *
 * A model's animation (ObjectModel_44) is one flat byte block. It is cut into
 * fixed-size keys of
 *
 *     keyStride = 3 * numberOfAnimatedVertices + 12
 *
 * bytes: twelve bytes of header followed by three signed bytes per animated
 * vertex. Key k lives at animData + keyStride * (k + 2) -- the first two
 * strides are the base pose and a header the walk below never indexes
 * directly.
 *
 * The three bytes per vertex are a *delta*, not a position. So a pose is
 * reached by starting from the base pose and adding every key up to the one
 * wanted, and moving to a neighbouring frame costs one key's worth of adds or
 * subtracts rather than a full rebuild. ModelInstance::vertices[2] holds that
 * running sum -- it is a Vec3s array, three s16 per animated vertex, not the
 * Vertex array its declared type suggests.
 *
 * obj->animFrame is 12.4 fixed point: the whole part selects the key, the low
 * four bits interpolate towards the next one. The fractional part is built
 * into D_8011D644 (a 0xC00-byte scratch the model code allocates at startup,
 * object_models.c:57) and added on at the end, so the accumulated sum stays
 * exact and only the display copy carries the interpolation.
 *
 * The twelve header bytes of a key carry four big-endian s16 the RSP never
 * sees: the instance's x/y/z offset and its head tilt, interpolated the same
 * way as the vertices.
 *
 * Output double-buffers between vertices[0] and vertices[1], flipped through
 * animationTaskNum, because the previous frame's copy may still be in a
 * display list the GP has not finished with.
