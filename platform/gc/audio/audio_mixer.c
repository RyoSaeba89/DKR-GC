/*
 * The audio task: executing an N64 audio command list on the CPU.
 *
 * The game's sound engine is unchanged by the port. libultra's synthesiser
 * still runs -- alAudioFrame still walks the sequence and sound players once
 * per retrace and still emits a list of Acmd words. What is gone is the RSP
 * that used to execute that list, so this file executes it instead.
 *
 * The command set is the audio microcode ABI in include/PR/abi.h: a small
 * stack machine over a scratch area of 16-bit samples, with commands to load
 * and store buffers, decode ADPCM, resample, apply an envelope, mix with a
 * gain, and finally interleave a stereo pair out to DRAM. Fifteen opcodes
 * carry all the work, and all fifteen are implemented here -- that is not an
 * estimate, it is a census of the aXxx macros the synthesiser under
 * libultra/src/audio actually expands:
 *
 *     aSetBuffer 33  aMix 12  aLoadBuffer 10  aClearBuffer 10  aSaveBuffer 7
 *     aSetVolume 5   aDMEMMove 5   aResample 3  aLoadADPCM 3   aSegment 2
 *     aPoleFilter 2  aEnvMixer 2   aSetLoop 1   aInterleave 1  aADPCMdec 1
 *
 * Two properties make this tractable. The buffers are plain arrays rather than
 * anything hardware-shaped, so "DMEM" is just a static array here. And both
 * machines are big-endian, so sample data lifted straight out of the asset
 * image needs no byte swapping -- which is the single largest reason a port
 * like this is easier from N64 to GameCube than to a little-endian target.
 *
 * The arithmetic below is sm64-port's src/pc/mixer.c, scalar path, transcribed
 * opcode by opcode: the microcode is shared between the two games, so the
 * semantics carry across exactly. The one exception is A_POLEF, which
 * sm64-port does not implement and which is reconstructed here from the
 * coefficients its caller builds; its comment carries the derivation. What is
 * *not* shared, and is the port's own
 * work, is everything around it -- the command walker (sm64-port has none: it
 * redefines the aXxx macros to call the implementations directly and never
 * builds a list at all), the address normalisation below, and the instrument.
 *
 * DKR cannot take sm64-port's shortcut. audiomgr.c genuinely builds a list
 * into a double-buffered ACMDList, reads back the length alAudioFrame returns,
 * and hands the buffer to the scheduler as an OS_TASK; bypassing that would
 * mean rewriting the audio manager. Decoding w0/w1 keeps the game's
 * architecture exactly as the ROM has it.

 * so the guard is not load-bearing today -- it is there so a future buffer at

/*
 * Normalising an address the command list carries.
 *
 * The list holds two different flavours of DRAM pointer, and they do not
 * arrive the same way:
 *
 *   - most sites pass osVirtualToPhysical(p), which this port defines as the
 *     identity precisely so the mixer receives something it can dereference
 *     (see the note in ultra/os_system.c);
 *   - load.c passes K0_TO_PHYS(p) for the ADPCM decoder state and loop state,
 *     and that macro is a literal `& 0x1FFFFFFF`. It is not a call the port
 *     can intercept, and on the GameCube it strips the 0x80000000 that names
 *     MEM1.
 *
 * So the walker puts the bit back on anything that has lost it, exactly as
 * segmented_to_virtual does for display-list pointers in gfx/gfx_gx.c. All of
 * MEM1 lives at 0x80000000 and nothing the audio path touches lives below it,
 * so the test is unambiguous.

 *
 * This port originally wrote `ROUND_UP_16(nbytes) / sizeof(s16) / 2` pairs,

 * save.c then saves `outCount << 2` bytes from DMEM 0 regardless, so every

 * whatever was last at AL_TEMP_0 -- which is AL_RESAMPLER_OUT, the raw
 * un-enveloped voice output, at full amplitude. That is what pinned the
 * `peak` counter to 32767 on nearly every beat, and it is what the user heard
 * as "inaudible, ca craque dans tous les sens": half of every frame was noise.
 *
 * ref-sm64gc's aInterleaveImpl does `ROUND_UP_16(nbytes) / sizeof(s16) / 8`

     * `vol * (1 + (rate - 1) * (i + 1) / 8)` and each group of eight scales
     * them by `rate`. That is right for SM64's audio ABI and wrong for this
     * one, and the proof is in this repository rather than in any reasoning
     * about microcode. `libultra/src/audio/env.c` computes the value it hands
     * over as
     *
     *     a = (tgt - vol) / count; a *= 8;          -- _getRate
     *
     * a volume *difference* per eight samples, and then keeps its own copy of
     * the envelope in step with the RSP as
     *
     *     r = ((ratem << 16) + ratel) / 65536.0;
     *     ivol += (r * samples) / 8.0;             -- _getVol
     *
     * which is an addition. So the game's model of what the microcode does is
     * additive, and it is the authority here.
     *
     * Read multiplicatively, a perfectly ordinary DKR rate -- a segment of one
     * second gives `a` around 12, i.e. rate ~= 0xBE666 -- scaled every lane by
     * twelve within a single group of eight and then let the target clamp pin
     * it, so the gain sawtoothed once per eight samples and reset. That is
     * exactly the defect the 2026-09-06 capture measured: in the left channel,
     * every sample at a multiple of eight wrong, the error uncorrelated with
     * the signal and larger than it. `vol[0] * (rate - 0x10000)` also
     * overflowed a signed 32-bit multiply at those rates, which flipped the
     * ramp's sign on top of it.
     *
     * Also note the test below: with an increment, "rising" is `rate > 0` as a
     * signed 16.16 value. The old `(rate >> 16) > 0` called every rate smaller
     * than 1.0 -- every gentle fade IN -- a fade out, and clamped it to the
     * target from the wrong side.

 * A_POLEF: the reverb's damping filter.
 *
 * This is the one opcode ref-sm64gc does not implement, so unlike everything
 * above it is reconstructed rather than transcribed. The reconstruction is not
 * guesswork -- the caller pins the arithmetic down completely.
 *
 * `_filterBuffer` (libultra/src/audio/mips1/reverb.c:429) emits exactly three
 * commands:
 *
 *     aSetBuffer (0, buff, buff, count << 1);          // in place
 *     aLoadADPCM (32, lp->fcvec.fccoef);               // 16 s16 coefficients
 *     aPoleFilter(lp->first, lp->fgain, lp->fstate);
 *
 * and `_init_lpfilter` (drvrnew.c) fills those sixteen coefficients:
 *
 *     fc            = (lp->fc * 16384) >> 15
 *     lp->fgain     = 16384 - fc
 *     fccoef[0..7]  = 0
 *     fccoef[8+k]   = 16384 * (fc/16384)^(k+1),  k = 0..7
 *
 * Three things follow, and together they leave no freedom.
 *
 * 1. Loading the coefficients through aLoadADPCM puts them in the ADPCM book,
 *    which the decoder reads as book[0][0..7] (the two-samples-back predictor)
 *    and book[1][0..7] (the one-sample-back predictor). Here the first half is
 *    all zeros: the second pole is switched off, and what the reverb actually
 *    asks for is a one-pole filter. The eight powers in the second half are the
 *    RSP computing eight outputs per vector step; a scalar CPU needs only the
 *    first, because y[n-1] is available at every sample.
 *
 * 2. The fixed-point base is 16384, not the decoder's 2048 -- SCALE in
 *    drvrnew.c, and the reason `fgain = SCALE - fc` is written that way.
 *
 * 3. fgain + fc == 16384 exactly, so the filter has unity gain at DC. That is
 *    the property that makes it safe inside the delay loop, and the check that
 *    the shift is right: any other shift would make the reverb either die or
 *    run away.
 *
 * So per sample:  y = (fcoef[0] * y[-2] + fcoef[8] * y[-1] + gain * x) >> 14.
 *
 * The two-samples-back term is kept even though this game always loads zero
 * there, because it costs one multiply and it is what makes this a *pole*
 * filter rather than a special case that happens to work.
 *
 * State is POLEF_STATE, `short[4]` (include/PR/abi.h:250). Two slots hold the
 * output history; A_INIT means start from silence, which is what `lp->first`
 * requests on the first frame after the reverb is built.
 *
 * Why this matters beyond the tail's colour: `_saveBuffer(out_ptr, buff2)`
 * writes the *filtered* buffer back into the delay line, so the filter sits
 * inside the feedback path. Skipping it leaves an undamped accumulator, which
 * is why GC_AUDIO_FX had to force the reverb off while this was missing.
